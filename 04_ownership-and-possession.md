# Ownership and Possession

The Russian language doesn't have the verb "to have"—at least not in the conventional English sense. Instead, we use a different construction. Take the following for example:

**У меня́ есть па́спорт.**

In English, this would translate to "I have a passport". But in Russian, this literally translates to "By me there is a passport", or "A passport exists by me".

So what's going on here?

We're using the preposition **у**, meaning "by" or "at", then the personal pronoun (**меня́**, in this case), followed by the word **есть**, meaning "there is" or "there are", then ending with the nominative case of the thing or person that is possessed, owned, or being had. We need the nominative case here because in this Russian construction, this **па́спорт** is actually the subject. This is because we are saying literally "A passport exists by me".

This construction may sound odd to English speakers, but there are actually quite a few other languages, including Irish, Hindi, and Finish, that have similar constructions. 

Let's take a look at a few more examples:

- **У тебя́ есть газе́та?**

     \- *Do you have a newspaper?*

- **У меня́ есть докуме́нты.**

     \- *I have documents.*

- **У вас есть чемода́н?**

     \- *Do you have a suitcase?*

- **У меня́ есть ви́за.**

     \- *I have a visa*

- **У тебя́ есть дочь?**

     \- *Do you have a daughter?*

- **У вас есть пода́рки?**

     \- *Do you have any gifts?*
     
Note in the above examples how **есть** never changes its form. Here are a few more examples:

- **Како́й у тебя́ па́спорт?**

    \- *What kind of passport do you have?*
    
- **У меня́ кана́дский па́спорт.**

    \- *I have a Canadian passport.*
    
You'll notice here we're not using the word **есть**. **Есть** is used to indicate whether something or someone exists or is present. In the above examples, the speaker is assuming the listener already has a passport so there is no reason to ask whether the passport exists. Instead, the speaker is asking the listener to describe his or her passport. When the listener replies, there's still no need for **есть** because we already assume that a passport exists.

This concept is the same for parts of the body as well. For example, since we can assume that everyone has eyes, there is no need to use **есть** when asking about a listener's eyes, but rather the speaker can ask the listener to describe what color eyes they have.

Here are just a few more examples:

- **У тебя́ есть да́ча?**
 
    \- *Do you have a dacha (country house)?*
    
    **Есть.**
    
    \- *Yes, I do.*

- **У тебя́ больша́я да́ча?**
 
    \- *Is your dacha big?*
    
    **Да, больша́я.**
    
    \- *Yes, it is.*

Lastly, to indicative possession in the negative, replace the word **есть** with **нет**.

- **У меня́ нет па́спорт.**
    
    \- *I do not have a passport.*
    
- **У меня́ нет до́чери.**
    
    \- *I do not have a daughter.*

In Russian, there actually is a verb "to have", **име́ть**, however it's used most often with abstractions:

- **иметь право**

    \- *to have the right*
    
- **иметь возможность**

    \- *to have the opportunity*
