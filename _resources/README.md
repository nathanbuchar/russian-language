The following keyboard was bundled by myself with [Ukele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele) using the keyboard layout mentioned in [this](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6586998?start=0&tstart=0) with Apple support thread. This was done in an attempt to properly categorize the keyboard layout as Russian instead of "Other", as well as to add an icon consistent to that of the other Russian keyboards. To my knowledge, no such bundle currently exists.

To install the Russian Phonetic Keyboard with accents, follow these steps:

1. [Download the file](https://github.com/nathanbuchar/russian-language/raw/master/_resources/Russian%20-%20Phonetic%20Accents.bundle.zip) and then unzip it.

2. Move the unzipped `.bundle` file to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`.
  
    There are a number of ways to do this. If you do not know how to access your user's Library folder (Mac OS hides it in newer versions), then open finder, click on **Go** in the menu bar, click on **Go to Folder…**, then type `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts` and hit **Go**. This should open up a new—likely empty—Finder window. Drag the keyboard layout bundle into that folder to install it.
    
3. Open System Preferences and navigate to the **Keyboard** pane. Select the **Input Sources** tab, then hit the **+** button in the lower left corner. A new modal window should appear, and in the list on the left, select **Russian**, and then in the list on the right choose **Russian – Phonetic Accents**. There may be two… I don't know why this is. Just select the first one, then click **Add**.

4. Lastly, make sure "Show Input menu in menu bar" is checked at the bottom of the window.

5. You should now be able to use the Russian phonetic keyboard with accents!

To switch between input sources, you may either select your desired keyboard from the input sources menu bar item, or cycle through them by using the following key commands (these can be enabled in **System Preferences » Keyboard » Shortcuts » Input Sources**:

<kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd> - Select the previous input source.

<kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd> - Select the next input source.

To add an accent to a character, it is done in the same way as the English keyboard. Simply press <kbd>alt</kbd><kbd>'</kbd>, then release those keys and type the vowel you'd like to add the accent above.
