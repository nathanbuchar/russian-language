The following keyboard was bundled by myself with [Ukele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele) using the keyboard layout mentioned in [this](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6586998?start=0&tstart=0) with Apple support thread. This was done in an attempt to properly categorize the keyboard layout as Russian instead of "Other", as well as to add an icon consistent to that of the other Russian keyboards. To my knowledge, no such bundle currently exists.

To install the Russian Phonetic Keyboard with accents, download and unzip it, then you should be able to double click the bundle to install it. 

The `Russian - Phonetic Accents` keyboard layout should now be accessible in **System Preferences » Keyboard » Russian**. Click the + button and select it to enable it. Also make sure you have "Show Input menu in menu bar" checked. If you can't find the keyboard layout within the Russian tab, you may have to manually move it to `~/Library/Keyboard Layouts`, then restart your computer and try again.

To switch between input sources, you may either select your desired keyboard from the input sources menu bar item, or cycle through them by using the following key commands (these can be enabled in **System Preferences » Keyboard » Shortcuts » Input Sources**:

<kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd> - Select the previous input source.

<kbd>⌃</kbd><kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>Space</kbd> - Select the next input source.
