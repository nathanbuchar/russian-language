# Russian Verb Conjugation

If you've taken Spanish or German or maybe another language, you may be familiar with verb conjugations. In English, verbs don't change much in the present tense. Even though we do say "he read**s**" as opposed to "I read" or "you read", in many languages you have a different form for each person, and you'll see this is the case in Russian too.

There are two types of verbs and two types of conjugations in Russian, and they're grouped according to the endings they take. They're usually called the *I conjugation*, or the *е/ё-conjugation*, and the *II conjugation*, or the *и-conjugation*. Those names come from the characteristic vowel sound that you'll hear with many forms. The *е/ё-conjugation* uses a **е** or a **ё**, and the *и-conjugation*—ostensibly enough—uses **и**.


## I Conjugation

Also known as the **е/ё-conjugation**.

As a basic example, let's look at the endings for the present tense of the verb **читать** (to read).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><b>Читать (чита-)</b> – To read</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>я чита́<b>ю</b></td>
    <td>мы чита́<b>ем</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ты чита́<b>ешь</b></td>
    <td>вы чита́<b>ете</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>он чита́<b>ет</b></td>
    <td>они чита́<b>ют</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

You'll notice that the endings are different for every person. There's a **я** form, a **ты** form, etc., and these verb endings change so that the verb agrees with the subject. We can look at these as a stem, **чита-**, to which we can add the appropriate endings.

Let's look at a similar verb: **знать** (to know).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><b>Знать (зна-)</b> - To know</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>я зна́<b>ю</b></td>
    <td>мы зна́<b>ем</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ты зна́<b>ешь</b></td>
    <td>вы зна́<b>ете</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>он зна́<b>ет</b></td>
    <td>они зна́<b>ют</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

So our stem here is **зна-**. Note that when the stem ends in a vowel, as in these first two verbs, we'll spell the ending of the **я** and the**они** forms with the letter **ю**.

Let's look at another *е/ё-conjugation* verb: **писать** (to write).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><b>Писать (пиш-)</b> – To write</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>я пиш<b>у́</b></td>
    <td>мы пи́ш<b>ем</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ты пи́ш<b>ешь</b></td>
    <td>вы пи́ш<b>ете</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>он пи́ш<b>ет</b></td>
    <td>они пи́ш<b>ут</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

So what do you notice here that is different? Well, there are a couple of things:

First of all, the **я** and **они** forms are spelled differently. Here, we've used the letter **у** instead of **ю**.

Second, the stem is changing. You'll see that the infinitive had an **с**, but these present tense forms have **ш** instead. Strange. Now, how do we know that that's supposed to happen? Here's the bad news:

**You cannot reliably predict verb conjugations from the infinitive. You *must* learn the conjugation separately.**

But the news is not all bad. Russian verbs are not completely random; There are patterns and some strategies that you can learn that will help, but still you cannot predict which pattern to apply just by looking at the infinitive. So, your best strategy is to learn three forms: The **я** form, the **ты** form, and the **они** form. If you know those, you can predict nearly all other forms of any verb.

Let's take a look at some of the patterns that may help with the *е/ё-conjugation*:

1. **The ты, он, мы, and вы forms always start with either е or ё.**

    The **ты**, **он**, **мы**, and **вы** form endings start with the vowel **е**, or the vowel **ё** if the ending is stressed.
2. **-ю, -ют after vowel stems.**

    If the stem ends in a vowel, the **я** form ending is **-ю**, and the **они** form ending is **-ют**. 
3. **-у, -ут after consonant stems.**

    If the stem ends in a consonant, the **я** form ending is **-у**, and the **они** form ending is **-ут**.

With these rules in mind, let's look at the verb **жить** (to live).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><b>Жить (жив-)</b> – To live</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>я жив<b>у́</b></td>
    <td>мы жив<b>ём</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ты жив<b>ёшь</b></td>
    <td>вы жив<b>ёте</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>он жив<b>ёт</b></td>
    <td>они жив<b>у́т</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Just as with **писать**, the stem here ends in a consonant, so the **я** form ending is **-у**, and the **они** form ending is **-ут**.

Now, note that there is no **в** in the infinitive. So how do we know that the stem is **жив-**? Because we've gone ahead and learned the **я**, **ты**, and **они** forms separately. Unfortunately there's no magic rule for deriving **жив-** from the infinitive **жить**.

There's one more important pattern here that has to do with the **ты**, **он**, **мы**, and **вы** forms: here we see that if the ending is stressed, then the vowel of the ending is **ё**. And how do you know if the endings are stressed? Well once again,  because you've learned the **я**, **ты**, and **они** forms.

Although you cannot predict the stress from the infinitive it's true that there are only three possibilities.

1. **Fixed stress on stem.**

    With verbs like **читать**, the stress is always in the same place—it's fixed somewhere on the stem and not on the verb ending.
    
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>чит|<b>а́</b>|-ю</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>чит|<b>а́</b>|-ешь</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>чит|<b>а́</b>|-ет</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>чит|<b>а́</b>|-ем</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>чит|<b>а́</b>|-ете</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>чит|<b>а́</b>|-ют</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

2. **Fixed stress on ending.**

    With other verbs, stress can always be on the ending, like with **жить**. So it is fixed, and always on the last syllable.
    
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>жив-|<b>у́</b>|</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>жив-|<b>ё</b>|шь</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>жив-|<b>ё</b>|т</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>жив-|<b>ё</b>|м</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>жив-|<b>ё</b>|те</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>жив-|<b>у́</b>|т</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

3. **Shifting stress.**

    Lastly, with **писать** we saw that stress could be mobile and could move around. The good news is that in this category, stress will be on the ending for the **я** form, and one syllable back from the ending for all the other forms. So it's not random—it is consistent for this specific pattern.

    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>пиш-|<b>у́</b>|</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>п|<b>и́</b>|ш-ешь</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>п|<b>и́</b>|ш-ет</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>п|<b>и́</b>|ш-ем</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>п|<b>и́</b>|ш-ете</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>п|<b>и́</b>|ш-ут</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

Now, do we really care about stress? And the answer is: absolutely, yes we do. Not just for the sake of good pronunciation, but if you want to tell someone to do something—to use the command form, as you will later learn—you will often need to know the stress pattern to figure out what the command form should look like. So in the long run if you're serious about Russian, be sure to put stress marks on your flash cards, and say your new words aloud as much as possible so you come to know what just sounds right. 

This may seem like a lot of rules, but if you get in the habit of learning the **я**, **ты**, and **они** forms you'll get used to the most common patterns before too long. 


## II Conjugation

Also known as the **и-conjugation**.

As a basic example, let's look at the endings for the present tense of the verb **говори́ть** (to speak).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><b>Говорить (говор-)</b> – To speak</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>я говор<b>ю́</b></td>
    <td>мы говор<b>и́м</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ты говор<b>и́шь</b></td>
    <td>вы говор<b>и́те</b</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>он говор<b>и́т</b></td>
    <td>они говор<b>я́т</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

In the **ты**, **он**, **мы**, and **вы** forms, we see the characteristic **и** that gives this conjugation its name.

The **я** form normally ends in **-ю** and the **они** form has the ending **-ят**. When we look a these **я** and **они** forms, there's one other important point to touch on. You'll recall that Russian has [three important spelling rules](./01_spelling-rules.md): the five-letter, the seven-letter, and the eight-letter spelling rules. It's this last rule that will be important here. To recall: we never write **ю** or **я** after **к**, **г**, **х**, **ж**, **ш**, **щ**, **ч**, or **ц**. Instead, we'll use the letters **у** and **а**.

The **я** and **они** forms in the *и-conjugation* have the vowels **ю** and **я**respetively, so we'll need to keep this in mind whenever the stem of the verb ends in any of the aforementioned letters.

**Учиться** (to study) is a common word where this comes into play. Let's take a look:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><b>Учиться (уч-)</b> – To study</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>я уч<b>у́сь</b></td>
    <td>мы у́ч<b>имся</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ты у́ч<b>ишься</b></td>
    <td>вы у́ч<b>итесь</b</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>он у́ч<b>ится</b></td>
    <td>они у́ч<b>атся</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

So here because of the last letter of that stem, we spell the **я** form with the letter **у**, and the **они** form with the letter **а**. It doesn't really affect the pronunciation, but you really want to make sure you get the spelling right for these forms.

One other thing worth noticing about the *и-conjugation* verbs is that the consonant at the end of the stem can often change, but this will happen in the **я** form only. For example, let's look at **видеть** (to see).

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2"><b>Видеть (вид-)</b> – To see</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>я ви́<b>жу</b></td>
    <td>мы ви́д<b>им</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ты ви́д<b>ишь</b></td>
    <td>вы ви́д<b>ите</b</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>он ви́д<b>ит</b></td>
    <td>они ви́д<b>ят</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Here you see that the **д** becomes **ж**, but only in the **я** form of the verb. You may remember that consonants can change in the *е/ё-conjugation too* but in those verbs it will typically change in all of the forms and not just the **я** form. 


# In summary

* 2 conjugations: *е/ё-conjugation* and *и-conjugation*
* Conjugations **cannot** be predicted from the infinitive.
  * Be sure to learn the **я**, **ты**, and **они**  forms.
* I Conjugation:
  * **Я** form and **они** form end in **ю**/**ют** after vowels, **у**/**ут** after consonants.
  * Other endings have **-ё-** when the ending is stressed, otherwise **-е-**.
* II Conjugation
  * **Ты**, **он**, **мы**, and **вы** forms have **-и-**.
  * **Я** form: **-ю**/-у.
  * **они** form: **-я/-а**.
  * Be aware of the eight-letter spelling rule.
