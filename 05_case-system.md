In English we have the concept of an object of a preposition, so we don't say "She spoke to **I**" or "I thought about **he**", we use the object pronouns (**me**, **him**, and others) after the prepositions **to** and **about**.

Russian will do something much like this, but a lot more consistently. In English, only pronouns change form after a preposition and nouns don't change. In Russian though, basically all nouns will take different endings after a preposition. Different prepositions will govern different cases—that is, they require different sets of endings.

## Prepositional

Of this six Russian cases there is one which never occurs without a preposition, this case is ostensibly called the **prepositional case**.

In the prepositional case, most nouns will end in **-е**, which is just added to the end of masculine nouns. For example:

* **чемода́н** → **в чемода́н*е***

* **слова́рь** → **в словар*е́***

Notice how the only function of the soft sign at the end of **«слова́рь»** was to show that that final **р** was soft. The letter **е** that we add also shows that the preceding consonant is soft so we won't need the soft sign anymore and we can remove it before adding the **-е** ending.

With feminine and neuter nouns the prepositional **-е** ending replaces the final vowel of the nominative form of the word.

* **кни́га** → **в кни́г*е*** (f)

* **ку́хня** → **в ку́хн*е*** (f)

* **окно́** → **в окн*е́*** (n)

* **пла́тье** → **в пла́ть*е*** (f)

Here are a few more prepositional transforms for practice.

* **журна́л** → **журна́л*е***

* **го́род** → **го́род*е***

* **ви́за** → **ви́з*е***

* **па́спорт** → **па́спорт*е***

* **Аме́рика** → **Аме́рик*е***

* **Кана́да** → **Кана́д*е***

* **дом** → **дом*е***

* **квартси́ра** → **квартси́р*е***

However, there are some common words that end in **и** in the prepositional. The words that take this **-и** ending are feminine nouns that end in a soft sign (**ь**).

* **крова́ть** → **в крова́т*и***

* **тетра́дь** → **в тетра́д*и***

Lastly, there are some nouns that end in **й**, **ия**, or **ие**. Any of these words, regardless of their respective gender, will end in a double **-ии** in the prepositional case. 

* **кафете́рий** → **в кафете́ри*и***

* **Росси́я** → **в Росси́*и***

* **общежи́тие** → **в общежи́ти*и***

* **А́нглия** → **в А́нгли*и***

* **Фра́нция** → **в Фра́нци*и***

* **Ита́лия** → **в Ита́ли*и***

* **Герма́ния** → **в Герма́ни*и***

Fortunately, the prepositional plural is a lot simpler. It is one basic ending, with two possible spellings: **-ах** and **-ях**.

We'll use **-ах** for stems ending in a hard consonant…

* **дом** → **дом*ах***

* **кварти́ра** → **кварти́р*ах***

* **окно́** → **о́кн*ах***

And we'll use **-ях** for stems ending in a soft consonant.

* **музе́й** → **мозе́*ях***

* **слова́рь** → **слова́р*ях***

* **крова́ть** → **крова́т*ях***

Notice here how we're dropping the **й** and the **ь** before we add the ending. Some more examples:

* **ку́хня** → **ку́хн*ях***

* **общежи́тие** → **общежи́ти*ях***

* **ве́рсия** → **ве́рси*ях***

* **пла́тье** → **пла́ть*ях***


### Usage

There's a reason the prepositional case is called the "prepositional": It's the only case in Russian that's always used with some preposition. Let's take a look at three of the most common prepositions that are used with this case.

1. **в** is a preposition in Russian that often has the sense of **in** or **at** in English. Here are a few examples:

    * **в маши́не** – *in the car*

    * **в ко́мате** – *in the room*

    * **в университе́те** – *at/in the university*


2. **на** is a preposition in Russian that often translates to **on** or **at** in English. Here are a few examples:

    * **на конце́рте** – *at the concert*

    * **на столе́** – *on the table*

    * **на ле́кции** – *at the lecture*
    
3. **о** with prepositional case endings means **about** in the sense of "talking about" or "thinking about", etc. Here are a few examples:

    * **о конце́рте** – *about the concert*

    * **о Росси́и** – *about Russia*

    * **об етой книге** – *about this book*
    
    In the last example you can see that **о** has an alternate form **об** which is used before words that start with vowel sounds. It's not unlike **a** vs **an** in English.


### Summary

* Singular nouns:
  * Most end in **-e**
    * Most masculine nouns.
  * Some end in **-и**
    * Feminine nouns ending in **-ь**.
    * Nouns ending in **-й**, **-ия**, or **-ие**.
* Plural nouns:
  * **-ах** after hard consonants.
  * **-ях** after soft consonants.
* Prepositional case endings
  * Used after **в** and **на** when answering the question **где**.
  * Used after **о** for the meaning "about" or "concerning".
* Using a different case with **в**, **на**, and **о** will change their meanings.
