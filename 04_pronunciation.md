It is often said that Russian spelling is more regular than English spelling, and that's true, but there are a few situations where Russian spelling can be deceptive and doesn't give an accurate picture as to how certain sounds are pronounced.


## Final Devoicing

Russian uses final devoicing, that is, at the end of the word, most consonants are devoiced, meaning they're pronounced like they're voiceless counterparts. But what are voiced and voiceless consonants?

Voiced consonants are letters that are pronounced in part by vibrating the vocal cords—the structures in your throat that produce your voice—whereas voiceless consonants are pronounced without vibrating your vocal cords.

In English, the letter **b** is voiced, as is **d**, **g**, and so on. The same can be said for the Russian consonants **б**, **д**, **г**, **з**, and **ж**.

Most voiced consonants also have voiceless counterparts—the have same or very similar pronunciation, just without using the vocal cords. The following are the Russian voiced-voiceless pairs. These letters can be pronounced by voicing or devoicing it's respective counterpart.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Voiced</th>
    <th>Voiceless</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>б</b></td>
    <td><b>п</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>д</b></td>
    <td><b>т</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>г</b></td>
    <td><b>к</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>з</b></td>
    <td><b>с</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>ж</b></td>
    <td><b>ш</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now, why do we care about this? Well it's actually really important for good pronunciation. In Russian, a voiced consonant at the end of a word will generally be devoiced—that is, pronounced like its voiceless counterpart. Let's look at the following for example:

**зуб**
    
Because this word ends in **б**, a voiced consonant, we pronounce this word as *\[zoo**p**\]*, and not *\[zoo**b**\]*. Let's look at a few more examples.

* **сад** – *\[sa**t**\]*

* **друг** – *\[droo**k**\]*

* **муж** – *\[moo**sh**\]*

* **указ** – *\[ooká**s**\]*

* **любовь** – *\[l'ubó**f**'\]*

As an aside, you may have noticed that English spellings of Russian names sometimes end in a **v** (like **Ivanov**) and sometimes are spelled with an **f** (like **Smirnoff**). Now we know why there could be some hesitation here; spellings with **f** reflect the Russian pronunciation, whereas spellings in **v**  reflect the Russian spelling.

**Exceptions**

In Russian, there are some voiced consonants that do not have any voiced counterparts. These letters are **л**, **м**, **н**, and **р**. Unlike the previous letters, these remained voiced when they are at the end of a word. Here are a few examples:

* **стол** – *\[sto**l**\]*

* **там** – *\[ta**m**\]*

* **сон** – *\[so**n**\]*

* **царь** – *\[tsa**r**'\]*


## Voicing in Clusters

Besides at the end of the word, there's another common situation when we'll hear this devoicing of a voiced consonant. First, let's consider what happens when two or more consonants come together in a cluster.

It's fine to have two voiceless consonants together…

* **утка** – *\[ú**tk**a\]*

* **стол** – *\[**st**ol\]*

And it's no problem to have two voiced consonants side-by-side…

* **тогда** – *\[tó**gd**a\]*

* **здесь** – *\[**zd**'es'\]*

But, Russian does not like to have a voiced and voiceless consonants right next to each other.


### Assimilation of Voicing

When you see a voiced consonant followed by a voiceless one in spelling, the voiceless character of that second one will carry back to the first causing it to devoice so that now that originally voiced consonant will sound like its voiceless counterpart even though, again, the spelling won't usually reflect this. This is called *assimilation*, because the first sound is becoming more similar to the second.

Listen how the voiceless **к** in this word makes the voiced **б** sound like a voiceless **п**.

* **юпка** – *\[úpk**a\]*

Unlike when we say *vodka* in English, in Russian, the letter **д** will be pronounced as if it were a voiceless **т**.

* **водка** – *\[vó**tk**a\]*

In the same way, the voiced **ж** devoices to sound to like **ш**.

* **ложка** – *\[ló**shk**a\]*

And in this word, the voiced **в** will sound like a voiceless **ф**.

* **всё** – *\[**fs**'o\]*

Sometimes this devoicing can even jump across word boundaries, especially since prepositions are normally pronounced as if they were at the beginning of the following word.

Pay special attention to the pronunciation of **в**, meaning *in* or *into*, in the following phrases. If the next word begins with a voiceless consonant, be sure to pronounce the **в** as its voiceless counterpart: **ф**.

* **в Сочи** – *\[**fs**óchi\]*

* **в томске** – *\[**ft**ómske\]*

But, if the next word begins with a voiced consonant or a vowel, then the  **в** will be voiced.

* **в Москве** – *\[**vm**óskvе\]*

* **в Омске** – *\[**vó**mske\]*

Some of these consonant clusters can be challenging for native speakers of English, and a pretty common mistake is to always pronounce the preposition **в** as voiced, then maybe to put a little vowel sound before the next word so for **«в Сочи»** you get something like *\[vi Sochi\]*. But we want to be sure to avoid this tendency. 

You may have noticed that it's always the *following* consonant that affects the consonant that precedes it, it's always going backwards. This is also true when the last consonant of a cluster is voiced and the preceding one is voiceless. The voiced quality of the proceeding consonant changes the preceding one to voiced. 

Listen to how the voiceless **с** in this word sounds like a voiced **з**, because it's followed by the voiced **д**.

* **сделать** – *\[**zd**'élat'\]*

And here, the voiceless **т** of the word **вот** becomes voiced when it's followed by **д**, so here is what sounds like two **д** sounds.

* **вот дочь** – *\[vó**dd**óch'\]*

As we saw before though, there are four consonants that don't get involved in this voicing and devoicing business. So, **л**, **м**, **н**, and **р** don't generally become devoiced. 

Listen for how the **л** here is voiced even before the voiceless **к**.

* **полка** – *\[pó**lk**a\]*

And these same four letters do not cause a preceding consonant to become voiced. So here, you can hear how the **т** in **от** remains voiceless, even before the voiced **м**.

* **от меня** – *\[a**t m**'enyá\]*


**Exceptions**

We should add one exception: the letter **в**. Although it does become devoiced at the end of the word, it does not cause a preceding voiceless consonant to become voiced. So in this word for example, the **с** remains voiceless even though it's followed by the voiced **в**.

* **связь** – *\[**sv**yæs'\]*


## Summary

* Voiced consonants are pronounced by vibrating the vocal cords.
* Voiceless consonants are pronounced without vibrating the vocal cords.
* Final devoicing.
  * Exceptions: **л**, **м**, **н**, **р**.
* Consonant clusters are either pronounced as either only voiced or voiceless consonants.
* Last consonant influences preceding one(s).
* **л**, **м**, **н**, **р** are always voiced, even before voiceless consonants.
* **в** does not cause voicing.
